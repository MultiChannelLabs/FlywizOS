# About the display module
## Why do we make Linux display solutions
At present, with the development of technology, the human-computer interaction scheme has been upgrading. And the development of human-computer interaction in some traditional fields is relatively slow. In the traditional field, there are many display solutions based on single-chip microcomputer, single-chip microcomputer + FPGA, which have solved the difficult problem of interactive development of color screen display for many customers. But with the increase in user needs and interactive content, traditional hardware limitations can no longer meet most of the customer needs, so we made this product. Empower the convenient human-computer interaction experience solution in the traditional field + the access capability of the IoT, and help the development of the IoT.

## Product advantages

* **Compared with the traditional single-chip serial port screen or single-chip + FPGA display solution**
1. Provides the latest interactive experience like mobile phones and tablet computers, with high customer acceptance, low product learning costs, and good display effects
2. The technology of multi-layer virtualization is realized through software, which solves the problem that the traditional display scheme limits the number of layers
3. Support png format decoding ability, so that the image layer overlay effect is better
4. From the system level, it supports WiFi, Ethernet, 2G, and 4G access capabilities to provide customers with more convenient access to the network; at the same time, it is convenient to quickly access WeChat IoT, WeChat Pay, Alipay and other platforms, which can be shared the industry provides fast IoT terminal solutions.
5. Provide video decoding capabilities, more convenient to display information to users.
* **Comparing Android and traditional Linux solutions**
1. Provides a stable hardware for testing, saving the cycle of testing and verification of hardware development
2. Provide system development work for the IoT + display, saving the time for the system to re-develop and debug the system on the IoT and display
3. Provides low-cost and high-efficiency operating capabilities: The current system runs on 1G single-core CPU, 64MBDDR2, 16MB Flash, saving more than 50% of hardware costs
4. Provide development tools with configuration + user logic source code to facilitate customers to quickly complete customized development; the development cycle is at least 60% less than the traditional method.
5. The deeply customized system has the ability to quickly start up in 3 seconds and safely run 24 hours * 365 days.
