# <span id = "first_run">First use of FlywizOS integrated development tool</span>
If you have successfully installed [FlyThings IDE](download.md), then on your desktop, fine the ![ZKSW-Editor快捷方式](assets/ide/quick_link.png) shortcut and double-click to run it.  
If you delete the shortcut, you can also find it in the `bin` folder in the installation directory, find ![ide](assets/ide/ide.png) and run it directly.

## Choose a workspace
When you run the tool, the following interface will pop up.
* **Workspace** is used to store related settings and historical records. You can understand it as a container, which can manage multiple projects at the same time, so there is no need to run multiple development tools at the same time.

## Welcome screen
If you open the software for the first time, or choose a new workspace, then you will see a welcome interface like the picture below.
It provides two shortcut functions: **New Project** and **Import Project**

  * **New Project**  
    It will guide you step by step [How to create a new FlywizOS project](new_flythings_project.html)
  * **Import Project**
    Through it, you can import existing projects into the current workspace and continue previous development. [How to import a project](import_project.md)
