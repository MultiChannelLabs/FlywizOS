# <span id="ide_introduce"> FlywizOS IDE Introduction to the use of work area</span>  
When your new project is completed, you will see the following interface

  ![The interface after the new project is completed](assets/ide//default_layout.png)  

The editor is roughly divided into six areas. The respective functions are as follows :
  1. **① Area-Project Explorer** It displays the resource files and code files in the project folder in the form of a tree diagram. You can expand/collapse freely, double-click the file to directly open it for editing. The specific demonstration is as follows:

  2. **② Area-UI edit box** is mainly responsible for the editing and instant preview of the UI interface, it is the main operation area in the development

  3. **③ Area-Control Panel** It contains all the built-in controls. You can click to select the control you need, and drag it to **②area** to complete the creation of the control. The specific demonstration is as follows:

  4. **④ Area-Properties Table** When you select a control in **area②**, all its properties will be displayed in the form of a table here, and you can customize and modify it in the table. For example, to modify the text size, the specific demonstration is as follows:

  5. **⑤Area-Outline View** It displays all the created controls in the form of a tree diagram; it also supports free expansion/collapse; can clearly understand the hierarchical relationship between controls; and you can directly drag a node, quickly Adjust the position of the hierarchy; double-click the node to quickly show/hide the controls. This is very easy to use when the hierarchy is complicated. The specific demonstration is as follows:

  6. **⑥ Area-Console** When compiling the code, this location will output the compilation log. If the compilation fails, double-click **error prompt content** to jump directly to the corresponding code.
 As shown in the figure below, it demonstrates that double-click the error message and jump directly to the code.

After learning the above basics, now, we can officially start development.
