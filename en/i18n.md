## Multi-language
FlywizOS provides multi-language function to facilitate internationalization.
### How to add
1. First, create a multi-language file through the new wizard.
   
   ![](assets/ide/new_i18n_file.gif)
   
2. After creation, a subfolder named **i18n** will be generated under the project, and the default tr file will be added. The file name of each tr file represents the corresponding language (do not modify the file name at will).
3. Double-click to open the tr file, you can see that the content is in xml format. Each string tag represents a translation. The **name** attribute is used to give an alias (it is recommended to name it as a combination of English, numbers, and underscores), and then use the alias to represent the string in the code.
 > Note: The alias cannot be repeated in the same configuration file.  

~~~xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
<resources>
    <string name="hello_world">Hello world!</string>
    <string name="hello_flywizos">Hello, FlywizOS</string>
</resources>
~~~
If you want to wrap in the string, use `&#x000A;` to escape, as follows:
~~~xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
<resources>
    <string name="new_line_test">first line&#x000A;second line</string>
</resources>
~~~

As shown above, we will alias the string **"hello, world!"** as `hello_world`, and alias the string **hello, FlywizOS** as `hello_flywizos`, if we want to add For more translations, we just need to add the `string` tag according to the example.

4. Since it is a multi-language, we have to add the same `name` tag to each language. In this way, when we switch languages, the system will replace the content according to the `name` attribute.
5. After the configuration file is added, we can use it in the ui file and code.  

6. Open the ui file, we can input **@hello_world** in the text property (we use the **@** symbol followed by the alias in the configuration file to indicate that this string needs to be translated). Then, we download and run, you can see that the content of the text has been automatically translated into **Hello, world! **

7. We can also translate strings in the code. Previously, we used the `setText()` function to set the string. If we need automatic translation, we need to use the `setTextTr()` function.
    E.g :    
 ```c++
/**
 * Triggered when the activity is constructed
 */
static void onUI_init() {
	// The parameter of setTextTr() is the name value in the language file. Note: The string passed in here does not need to be
    // preceded by the @ symbol
	mTextview1Ptr->setTextTr("hello_world");
}
 ```
 Download and run, we can see that the content has been replaced with the corresponding string.

8. We can also get the value corresponding to the current language name, and then do some operations like splicing, etc.:

```c++

#include "manager/LanguageManager.h"

static bool onButtonClick_Button1(ZKButton *pButton) {
    //LOGD(" ButtonClick Button1 !!!\n");
    std::string hello = LANGUAGEMANAGER->getValue("hello");
    std::string world = LANGUAGEMANAGER->getValue("world");
    std::string ret = hello + " " + world;
    LOGD("ret: %s\n", ret.c_str());
    return false;
}

```

### How to switch language
1. The default language of the system is **zh_CN** (Simplified Chinese). 
2. You can open the system's built-in language switch activity to select a language.  
Add the following code to open the activity.
```c++
EASYUICONTEXT->openActivity("LanguageSettingActivity");
```
Or use the following API to switch languages freely.

   ```c++
     EASYUICONTEXT->updateLocalesCode("zh_CN"); //Set to Chinese
     EASYUICONTEXT->updateLocalesCode("en_US"); //Set to English
     EASYUICONTEXT->updateLocalesCode("ko_KR"); //Set to Korean
   ```

### Font requirements       
   Multiple language requires font support. If the text does not exist in the font, it will be displayed abnormally. Therefore, the font must contain text in multiple languages.
   > The default font of the system is a simplified version. It is recommended to add custom fonts, see [Font cutting](font_cut_tool.md).
