# <span id="new_flythings_project">How to create a new FlywizOS UI file</span>  
Creating a new UI file is similar to [New FlywizOS Project](new_flywizOS_project.md#new_flywizOS_project).
1. In the Project Explorer, expand the project that needs to create the UI file, select the **ui** folder under the project, then right-click, and in the pop-up menu, select the menu **New** -> **FlywizOS UI file**.

2. After the above operations, a **New FlywizOS UI File Wizard** box will pop up, as shown below:

   There are three parameters you want you to specify :
   
  * **File name**   
     You need to specify the file name of the UI file. The file name is named with letters and numbers, with **ftu** (FlywizOS UI File) as the suffix.
   * **Resolution**  
      You can control the width and height of the UI interface by adjusting the resolution, in pixels;  
   * **UI Type**   

      There are currently four window types: **Normal**, **Status Bar**, **Navigation Bar**, and **Screensaver**.  
      In general, we can keep the **normal** option. For specific explanations of the other three types, please refer to [System Application Introduction](system_app.md) 

   After confirming the parameters, select **Finish** to end the creation process. You can see the newly created UI file in the project's ui folder in the project explorer.
