The role of each folder is explained below.    \n\nui  folder\nExpand ui folder   \n    \nYou can see that a main.ftu file is included by default. ftu is the suffix of the UI file of the FlywizOS project. Each ftu file corresponds to an application interface. Usually, an application contains multiple interfaces, so you need to create multiple ftu files in the ui folder. To add a new ftu file, please refer to How to create a new FlywizOS UI file. For the convenience of description, in the following tutorials, the ftu file will be referred to as the UI file.\nYou can double-click to open the UI file, edit it, and preview the effect instantly. For the specific steps of editing the UI file, please refer to the tutorial of Introduction to Controls.\nAfter editing, you can start \"compile\" (How to compile)\n\n[!Note]\nNote: The compilation mentioned here is not only the compilation of the source code, but also a series of operations such as the preprocessing of the ui file and the generation of the template code, but these are all automated, and you do not need to manually operate. For all the specific operations behind compiling this action, please refer to The specific compilation process and the correspondence between the UI file and the source code. After reading it, I believe you will be easier to understand and get started quickly\n\n\nresources folder\nThe content of this folder is relatively simple, mainly used to store various resource files of the project, including pictures, fonts, input method configuration files, etc. However, due to the limitation of the machine's own storage space, it is not recommended to store large files in this directory. It is recommended that you store large resource files in the TF card.\n\n\nWe can get the absolute path of a file in the resources directory in the code.\n  For example: The following code can obtain the absolute path of resources/test.txt.\n #include \"manager/ConfigManager.h\"\n std::string resPath = CONFIGMANAGER->getResFilePathEx(\"test.txt\");\n\n\njni folder\n This folder is mainly for storing code files, and it also contains multiple parts of code. We expand the jni folder  As you can see, it contains 6 parts of activity, include, logic, uart, Main.cpp, Makefile, each the functions of each part are as follows:\n\nactivity subfolder\nStore the basic class code of the UI file. After each UI file is compiled, an Activity class and a Logic.cc file with the same prefix name will be generated. For example: there is a main.ftu in the ui folder, then after compilation, mainActivity.h, mainActivity.cpp and mainLogic.cc will be generated, and the mainActivity class will be stored in  In the activity folder, the mainLogic.cc file will be stored in the logic folder.\n\n[!Warning] \nIt is strongly recommended not to manually modify the code in the activity folder, except in special cases\n\n\nlogic subfolder\nStore specific logic codes. Same as the description above, every UI file will generate a Logic.cc file with the corresponding prefix name after compilation. *Note: Our custom code is mainly added to these Logic.cc files *.\n\ninclude subfolder\nThe header files related to the system and all control related header files are mainly stored here.\nuart subfolder\nAs the name implies, this folder stores serial port operation related codes, including reading and writing serial ports, protocol analysis, etc.\nMain.cpp\nThe entry code of the entire FlywizOS application, including the interface for selecting the boot and some initialization, generally does not need to modify this file.\nMakefile/Android.mk、Application.mk\nCompilation configuration file, which contains the specific source code compilation process, generally does not need to be modified  \n\n\n\nAfter the compilation is passed, the libs directory and the obj directory will be generated under the project, which are the compiled target storage directory and the compiled intermediate file directory, both of which can be cleaned up or deleted directly. It doesn't matter.\n"},"ftu_and_source_relationships.html":{"url":"ftu_and_source_relationships.html","title":"UI file and generated code explanation","keywords":"","body":"The FlywizOS compilation process and the correspondence between UI files and source code\nHow are controls in UI files associated with pointer variables\nFlywizOS separates the UI and code for easy management.\nIn the following, UI files refer to all ftu files in the ui folder of the project.\nIn order to reduce the repetitive code written during development, we improved the compilation process. Before the real source code is compiled, the tool will generate a Logic.cc file with the same prefix name according to the UI file. For example, main.ftu will generate a paired mainLogic.cc file. Here you need to pay attention to:The generation of the Logic.cc file is not a direct overwrite, but an incremental modification.When compiling, the tool will traverse each UI file and read the controls contained in the UI file. And declare a pointer variable for this control, in the code, through this pointer, you can operate the corresponding control. Pointer variables are defined in the Activity.cpp file with the same prefix name. Take main.ftu as an example, like this:\n  \nAs you can see in the figure, all pointers are static global variables, and they all have the same naming rules. For specific naming rules, please refer to Naming Rules for Control ID Names and Pointer Variable Names ; And, you should also notice the statement #include \"logic/mainLogic.cc\" in the screenshot, which includes the mainLogic.cc file into mainActivity.cpp, and our code is written in mainLogic.cc file, so we can fully use these control pointers in mainLogic.cc. If you are interested in the initialization of these pointers, you can find it in the onCreate function of mainActivity.\nThe relationship between UI files and Logic.cc files\nNow, you probably already know how the controls in the UI file are connected to these pointers. Let's take another look at what code is automatically generated for us in the mainLogic.cc file.\nIf you don't add any controls to your UI file, your mainLogic.cc file will look like this :\n/**\n * Register timer\n * Fill the array to register the timer\n * Note: id cannot be repeated\n */\nstatic S_ACTIVITY_TIMEER REGISTER_ACTIVITY_TIMER_TAB[] = {\n    //{0,  6000}, //Timer id=0, period 6 second\n    //{1,  1000},\n};\n\n/**\n * Triggered when the interface is constructed\n */\nstatic void onUI_init(){\n    //Add the UI initialization display code here, for example :\n    //mText1Ptr->setText(\"123\");\n\n}\n\n/**\n * Triggered when switching to this interface\n */\nstatic void onUI_intent(const Intent *intentPtr) {\n    if (intentPtr != NULL) {\n        //TODO\n    }\n}\n\n/*\n * Triggered when the interface is displayed\n */\nstatic void onUI_show() {\n\n}\n\n/*\n * Triggered when the interface is hidden\n */\nstatic void onUI_hide() {\n\n}\n\n/*\n * Triggered when the interface completely exits\n */\nstatic void onUI_quit() {\n\n}\n\n/**\n * Serial data callback interface\n */\nstatic void onProtocolDataUpdate(const SProtocolData &data) {\n\n}\n\n/**\n * Timer trigger function\n * It is not recommended to write time-consuming operations in this function, otherwise it will affect UI refresh\n * Parameter : id\n *         The id of the currently triggered timer is the same as the id at registration\n * Return : true\n *             Keep running the current timer\n *         false\n *             Stop running the current timer\n */\nstatic bool onUI_Timer(int id){\n    switch (id) {\n\n        default:\n            break;\n    }\n    return true;\n}\n\n/**\n * Triggered when there is a new touch event\n * Parameter : ev\n *         new touch event\n * Return : true\n *            Indicates that the touch event is intercepted here, and the system will no longer pass this touch event to the control\n *         false\n *            Touch events will continue to be passed to the control\n */\nstatic bool onmainActivityTouchEvent(const MotionEvent &ev) {\n    switch (ev.mActionStatus) {\n        case MotionEvent::E_ACTION_DOWN://Touch press\n//            LOGD(\"event time = %ld axis  x = %d, y = %d\", ev.mEventTime, ev.mX, ev.mY);\n            break;\n        case MotionEvent::E_ACTION_MOVE://Touch move\n            break;\n        case MotionEvent::E_ACTION_UP:  //Touch up\n            break;\n        default:\n            break;\n    }\n    return false;\n}\n\nThe specific functions of these functions are as follows:\n\nREGISTER_ACTIVITY_TIMER_TAB[ ]  arrayUsed for register timer; The array member type is the following structure\ntypedef struct {\n  int id; // Timer ID, cannot be repeated\n  int time; // Timer interval, unit millisecond\n}S_ACTIVITY_TIMEER;\n\nIn essence, this array will be referenced in the rigesterActivityTimer() function of mainActivity.cpp and registered to the system in turn by calling the void registerTimer(int id, int time) function.\n\nvoid onUI_init()It is used for activity initialization. If you need to initialize some content when opening this UI activity, then you can add code to this function.In essence, this function will be called in the onCreate() method of mainActivity.cpp. You can understand it as the structure of mainActivity.\n\nvoid onUI_quit()Used to exit the activity, if you need to do some operations when the UI activity exits, then you can add the code to this function.\nIn essence, this function will be called in the destructor of mainActivity.cpp\n\nvoid onProtocolDataUpdate(const SProtocolData &data)Used to receive serial port data. When the serial data frame is parsed, this function will be called.The essence is that in onCreate() of mainActivity.cpp, void registerProtocolDataUpdateListener(OnProtocolDataUpdateFun pListener) is called by default to register to receive serial port data, and the registration is cancelled in the destruction of mainActivity.cpp. When the serial port reads the data, the registered UI activity is called in turn through the void notifyProtocolDataUpdate(const SProtocolData &data) in ProtocolParser.cpp.This is the serial port analysis function in ProtocolParser.cpp, combined with the process described above, you should be able to understand how the serial port data is distributed on each activity:\n  /**\n   * Parse each frame of data\n   */\n  static void procParse(const BYTE *pData, UINT len) {\n      switch (MAKEWORD(pData[3], pData[2])) {\n      case CMDID_POWER:\n          sProtocolData.power = pData[5];\n          break;\n      }\n\n      // Notify protocol data update\n      notifyProtocolDataUpdate(sProtocolData);\n  }\n\n\nbool onUI_Timer(int id)Timer callback function; When a timer reaches the specified time interval, the system will call this function. When multiple timers are added, you can use the id parameter to distinguish the timers. The id parameter is the same as the id filled in the structure array above.Return true to continue running the current timer;Return false to stop running the current timer;If you stopped the timer by returning false, how do you start it again? Please refer to How to start and stop the timer arbitrarily\n\nbool onmainActivityTouchEvent(const MotionEvent &ev)Touch event callback function. Able to get all touch messages.Similarly, this function is also registered by default in mainActivity.cpp through the registerGlobalTouchListener function; touch messages can only be obtained after registration.Returning true means that the touch event is intercepted here and is no longer passed to the controlReturning false means that touch events will continue to be passed to the controlLearn more about the handling of touch events\n\n\nThe above is Logic.cc generated by compiling the default UI file. When we add controls to the UI file and compile again, the tool will generate different associated functions according to different controls to the corresponding Logic.cc file.For example : I added two button controls to the UI file of main.ftu, their IDs are Button1 and Button2, then, after compilation, the following two related functions will be generated in the mainLogic.cc file.\nstatic bool onButtonClick_Button1(ZKButton *pButton) {\n    //LOGD(\" ButtonClick Button1 !!!\\n\");\n    return false;\n}\n\nstatic bool onButtonClick_Button2(ZKButton *pButton) {\n    //LOGD(\" ButtonClick Button2 !!!\\n\");\n    return false;\n}\n\nPay attention to the naming of the function. The function name contains the ID name of the control, so we require the ID naming of the control to conform to the C language naming standard.If you continue to add controls, more related functions will be generated into the mainLogic.cc file after compilation.Usually, during development, we will add, delete, and modify controls many times in the UI file. For these situations, the current solutions are as follows :\n\nFor the case of adding a control, the tool will generate a correlation function based on the control ID name at compile time. If the same correlation function already exists, it will be skipped. Will not have any impact on the Logic.cc file.  \nIn the case of deleting a control, if you delete an existing control in the UI file, the tool will not delete its associated function. If the associated function is also deleted, it is likely to cause the loss of customer code, so we choose to keep it.\nIn the case of modifying the control, the generation of the associated function is only related to the control ID name.

The specific explanation of the associated functions generated by these controls is as follows :\n\n[!Note]\n The XXXX in the function represents the control ID name. Please replace it yourself in the actual process\n\n\nButton control\n static bool onButtonClick_XXXX(ZKButton *pButton) {\n    return false;\n }\n\n When the button is clicked, this function is called.\n\nThe parameter ZKButton *pButton is the pointer of the clicked button. A series of operations can be performed on the control through the member functions of the pointer. This pointer is the same object as the object pointed to by the global variable mXXXXPtr.\n\n\nEdit Text control\nstatic void onEditTextChanged_XXXX(const std::string &text) {\n\n}\n\nWhen the text in the input box changes, the system will automatically call this function.\n\nThe parameter std::string &text is the complete string in the current input box.\n\n\nSeek Bar control\nstatic void onProgressChanged_XXXX(ZKSeekBar *pSeekBar, int progress) {\n\n}\n\nWhen the current progress value of the Seek Bar changes, the system will automatically call this function.  \n\nParameter ZKSeekBar *pSeekBar is the pointer of the Seek Bar control, and a series of operations can be performed on the control through the member functions of the pointer.  \nParameter int progress is the progress value of the current Seek Bar.\n\n\n Slide window control\nstatic void onSlideItemClick_XXXX(ZKSlideWindow *pSlideWindow, int index) {\n\n}\n\nWhen you click an icon in the Slide window control, the system will automatically call this function.\n\nParameter ZKSlideWindow *pSlideWindow is the pointer of the Slide window control, and a series of operations can be performed on the control through the member functions of the pointer.\nParameter int index is the index value of the currently clicked icon. For example, a total of 10 icons are added to the Slide window, and the index value range is [0, 9]\n\n\nList control\nThe list control is the most complex control, it will create three associated functions. Although there are many functions, it is very easy to understand according to the following steps.\n\nFirst, if the system wants to draw a list control, it needs to know how many items it has. So there is the following correlation function\nstatic int getListItemCount_XXXX(const ZKListView *pListView) {\n\n    return 0;\n}\n\n\nParameter const ZKListView *pListView is the pointer of the List control, which points to the same object as the global variable mXXXXPtr.\nReturn value is an integer, which means how many items there are in the list, which can be defined according to your needs. \n\n\nAfter the system knows the number that needs to be drawn. But it is not enough. It also needs to know what content you display for each item.  So with the following function, it will be called multiple times to let you set the display content of each item until each item is processed.\nstatic void obtainListItemData_XXXX(ZKListView *pListView,ZKListView::ZKListItem *pListItem, int index) {\n //pListItem->setText(index)\n}\n\n\nParameter ZKListView *pListView is the pointer of the List control, which points to the same object as the global variable mXXXXPtr.\n\nParameter ZKListView::ZKListItem *pListItem is the pointer of the list item, corresponding to the Item in the UI file\n\nParameter int index is the index value of pListItem in the entire list. It has a certain range,For example: The return value of the getListItemCount_XXXX function is 10, which means there are 10 items in the list, so the range of index is [0, 9],Combining pListItem and index, you can know where the set list item is in the entire list.    \n In this function, you can set the display content of each item separately according to index.For example: The commented statement in the function means: each list item displays its corresponding index number.\n\n\n\nSimilar to the button control, the list control also has a click event, but it judges which list item is currently clicked based on the index value.\nstatic void onListItemClick_XXXX(ZKListView *pListView, int index, int id) {\n //LOGD(\" onListItemClick_ Listview1  !!!\\n\");\n}\n\nWhen the list control is clicked, the system will calculate the index number of the list item, and will automatically call this function.\n\nParameter ZKListView *pListView is the pointer of the List control, which points to the same object as the global variable mXXXXPtr.   \n\nParameter int index is the index value of the currently clicked list item in the entire List control\n\nParameter int id is the id of the currently clicked control. Note that this id is different from the ID name in the properties table.Its specific macros are defined in the corresponding Activity.h file. For example in mainActivity.h\nThe function of this id parameter is that when there are multiple sub-items in the list item, it can be used to distinguish which sub-item is currently clicked.For example: As shown in the figure below, I added two list items to the list item, and added a picture decoration as a switch button. The property ID names are SubItem1 and SubItem2 respectively. When I click on SubItem1, by judging the equal relationship between the parameter id and ID_MAIN_SubItem1 and ID_MAIN_SubItem2,\nYou can determine which switch was clicked.Specific code：\n static void onListItemClick_XXXX(ZKListView *pListView, int index, int id) {\n   //LOGD(\" onListItemClick_ Listview1  !!!\\n\");\n   switch(id) {\n   case ID_MAIN_SubItem1:\n       //LOGD(\"Clicked the first subitem of item %d in the list\", index);\n       break;\n   case ID_MAIN_SubItem2:\n       //LOGD(\"Clicked the second subitem of item %d in the list\", index);\n       break;\n }\n}\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  ![列表outline](assets/ListView-tree.png) \n  ![列表子项示例](assets/ListView-subitem.png)\nFinally, we use a picture to summarize the rules between them:\n\nOther controls and so on\n"},"editor_tip.html":{"url":"editor_tip.html","title":"Common skills in development tools","keywords":"","body":"Common settings for development tools\n Quick jump to related functions\nWhen we add too many controls to the UI file, multiple associated functions will also be generated in the Logic.cc file.

The specific steps are as follows :\n\nDouble click to open the main.ftu file\nFind the Text View control in the right control collection\nLeft-click the Text View control and hold it, then drag it to any position, release the left button, and you can see the automatically generated text view control.  \n\n\n\nHow to dynamically update text view content through code?\nIn the use of the serial port screen, the text view content is often updated dynamically. Then in the code, we can dynamically update the content of the text view control through the pointer corresponding to the Text View control. The specific steps are as follows :\n\nFirst of all, you need to know the pointer variable corresponding to the text view control in the code (If you don’t know the corresponding rules of the pointer variable name and the control ID in the UI file, click here), here is the text with the ID of Textview1. Take the text control with ID Textview1 as an example, its corresponding pointer variable is mTextview1Ptr.\nIf we want to modify the content of the Textview1 to \"Hello World\", it can be implemented by calling the member function of the text view control void setText(const char *text), in the corresponding Logic.cc file, The specific code is:\nmTextview1Ptr->setText(\"Hello World\");\n\nExamples of actual usage :\nThe function of the following code is: when the button with ID Button1 is pressed, the text with ID Textview1 is set to \"Hello World\"\nstatic bool onButtonClick_Button1(ZKButton *pButton) {\n   mTextview1Ptr->setText(\"Hello World\");\n   return false;\n}\n\n\nIn addition to setting strings, the text control also supports setting number and character:\n/* function definition header file: include/control/ZKTextView.h */\nvoid setText(int text);  // set number\nvoid setText(char text); // set character\n\n/* Operation example */\nmTextview1Ptr->setText(123); // Textview1 control will display the string \"123\"\nmTextview1Ptr->setText('c'); // The Textview1 control will display the'c' character\n\n\n\nHow to modify the color of text?\nThe default text is displayed in white, which usually cannot meet the requirements. You can modify the text color in the following two ways.\nModify the color of the control directly in the property bar\n In the project explorer, select a UI file and double-click to open it.\n On the preview interface, find the control you want to modify, left-click on it, and you can see the corresponding properties table of the control on the right side of the editor. At this time, you can fill in the custom property values as needed. As with Excel, find the property you need to modify, and then click modify.\n In the text view control, you can see that there are 3 table items related to the color property, namely\n\nForeground Colors\nThis property can set the color value of the text in each state of the control separately\n\n\nBackground color\nSet the background color of the entire rectangular area of the control (will not change according to the state of the control)\n\n\nBackground colors  \n\nTo extend the background color property, you can set the background color in each state of the control separately\n\nExample：  \n\nPreview：\n\nThe above figure is a screenshot of the color part of the properties table. The meaning is: the background color is set to black, and the text color is set to white. When the control is set to the selected state, the text color changes to red.\n\n\nControl color change through code\n   Setting the color in the properties table is intuitive and convenient, but it lacks flexibility. Therefore, in the code, the color can be dynamically controlled by calling the corresponding member function through the control pointer.\n  Take the text control with ID Textview1 as an example, the following functions can implement the purpose of modifying the color.(If you are not sure about the corresponding rules of the pointer variable name and the control ID in the UI file, click here)\n\nvoid setInvalid(BOOL isInvalid)  \n   //Set the control Textview1 to the invalid state; if the `color when invalid` property in the propert table is not empty, \n   //set it to the specified color, otherwise there is no change.\n mTextview1Ptr->setInvalid(true);\n\n\nvoid setSelected(BOOL isSelected)     \n   //Set the control Textview1 to the selected state; if the `color when selected` property in the property table is not\n   //empty, set it to the specified color, otherwise there is no change.\n    mTextview1Ptr->setSelected(true);\n\n\nvoid setPressed(BOOL isPressed)\n   //Set the control Textview1 to the pressed state; if the `color when pressed` property in the property sheet is not empty, \n   //set it to the specified color, otherwise there is no change.\n    mTextview1Ptr->setPressed(true);\n\n\nvoid setTextColor(int color) //The parameter color represents RGB color in hexadecimal.\n   //Set the control Textview1 to red.\n   mTextview1Ptr->setTextColor(0xFF0000);\n\n\n\nHow to display decimals\nThe Text View control provides an interface for setting string.\n    /**\n     * @brief Set string text\n     */\n    void setText(const char *text);\n\nIf you want to display any number, you can first use the snprintf function to format the number into a string, and then set the string to achieve the purpose of displaying content at will.Example：  \n  float n = 3.1415;\n  char buf[64] = {0};\n  snprintf(buf, sizeof(buf), \"%.3f\", n); //Fixed display 3 decimal places, extra decimal places will be ignored, if not enough, \n                                        //0 will be added\n  mTextView1Ptr->setText(buf);\n\nsnprintf is a C language standard function, you can search for relevant information on the Internet, or check here Brief introduction and usage example.\nImplement animation\nSince the text control can add a background image, we can use it to simply display a picture.One step further, if we dynamically switch the background image of the text control in the code, as long as the switching time interval is short enough, the animation effect can be implemented.\n\nPicture resource preparation A smooth frame animation necessarily requires multiple image resources. Here we have prepared a total of 60 photos.    \n You can see that each picture represents a frame and is named uniformly according to the serial number, which is mainly to facilitate subsequent use.    \n\nNote: The system will consume more resources when loading pictures. In order to run the interface smoothly, it is strongly recommended that the pictures should not be too large. For example, the size of a single image in the example is only about 5KB \n\n Copy these pictures to the resources directory of the project. You can create subfolders under the resources directory to facilitate the sorting of various image resources.\n \n\nCreate a text view control Create a text view control arbitrarily in the UI file. And set the background image of the text view control to one of the images. Here I set the first picture as the background picture. This step is just to automatically adjust the width and height of the text view control to the width and height of the picture, you can also choose not to set it.\n The complete properties are shown in the figure :  \n\nCompile the project, register the timer After adding the text view control, compile the project again, register a timer in the generated Logic.cc file and set the time interval to 50 ms. We use the timer to switch a picture every 50ms. How to compile the project?  \n How to register timer? \n\nDynamically switch the background of the text view controlIn the corresponding Logic.cc file, add the following function to switch the background image, and call it in the timer trigger function bool onUI_Timer(int id).   \nstatic void updateAnimation(){\n     static int animationIndex = 0;\n     char path[50] = {0};\n     snprintf(path, sizeof(path), \"animation/loading_%d.png\", animationIndex);\n     mTextviewAnimationPtr->setBackgroundPic(path);\n     animationIndex = ++animationIndex % 60;\n}\n\n\n\n   There are two points in the above function that we need to pay attention to :\n\nSwitching the background image of the text view control is implemented by the setBackgroundPic(char* path) function. \nThe parameter of the setBackgroundPic(char* path) function is the relative path of the picture. The path is relative to the resources folder in the project.  \n For example: as shown in the figure below, our image is placed under the folder resources/animation/ in the project, then the relative path of loading_0.png is animation/loading_0.png\n  \n The setBackgroundPic(char* path) function can also accept absolute paths. For example: if you put the image example.png in the root directory of TF card, its corresponding absolute path is /mnt/extsd/example.png, where /mnt/extsd/ is the mount directory of the TF card.. We recommend that all image resources be placed in the project's resoources folder or its subfolders, because image resources in other paths will not be automatically packaged into the software.  \n\n\n\nDownload and run, check the effect\n\nComplete sample download\n\n\nUse of picture character sets\nWe know that, according to the definition of ascii code, there is a correspondence between character char and integer int. For example, the ascii code of the character 0 is 48. The picture character set is a function of mapping the ascii code to the picture. After setting this function, when we display a string, the system will try to map each character in the string to a specified picture, and finally display a string of pictures on the screen. \n\nSetting method   \n  \nFind the Picture Character Set in the text view control, click on the More option on the right, and a picture character set selection box will pop up.  \n  \nSelect the import button in the upper right corner to add the picture to the character set. After adding the picture, you can modify the corresponding ascii code or character as the mapping character of the picture. Then click Save\n\nIf you want to verify whether the picture character set is added successfully, you can modify the text, and the preview effect will be synchronized on the preview.Note: If you set a picture character set, the system will try to map each character to a picture specified in the character set; if a character is not set to a picture, then this character will not be displayed on the screen. \n\nUse\n\nIn the above picture character set setting box, we have mapped the characters 0-9 and: colon as pictures respectively.\nThen in the code, set the string through the setText(char* str) function. Since we set a special character set in the TextTime text view control, the characters are converted to corresponding pictures. The renderings are as follows:\nstatic void updateTime() {\n  char timeStr[20];\n  struct tm *t = TimeHelper::getDateTime()\n  sprintf(timeStr, \"%02d:%02\", t->tm_hour, t->tm_min);\n  mTextTimePtr->setText(timeStr);\n}\n\n  \nIf you only need to display a single character, you can directly set the ascii code or character without converting it into a string.Example :\nmTextTimePtr->setText((char)48); //Set the ascii code directly, it needs to be \n                                 //converted to char\nmTextTimePtr->setText('0'); //Set character directly\n\n\n\nSample code\nSince there are many properties of text controls, please refer to the TextViewDemo project in Sample Code for more property effects.\nPreview :\n\n"},"button.html":{"url":"button.html","title":"Button","keywords":"","body":"Button class\nI need a button/key, how to add and modify attributes? \nIf you need a button, you can quickly implement it using the existing Button control.

If the actual width and height of the picture are not equal to the specified width and height parameters, the picture will be scaled according to the specified width and height:\n  \nUnderstand the hierarchical relationship of button controls\nFor general button controls, it will draw four levels of content, which are from top to bottom:\n\nThe text of the button\nThe picture of the button\nThe background picture of the button\nThe background color of the button\n\nHow to add picture buttons/keys?\nRefer to \"How to add more animation effects to buttons\"\nWhen pressing this key/button, where or how to add your own operation code？\nIn actual development, button is a kind of control that is used very frequently. Usually, after the button click event occurs, some processing is done, such as writing to the serial port or refreshing the UI content.\nTo respond to the click time of the button is very simple. The following are the specific steps :\n\nFirst create a button control and the property ID as Button1. How to create a button control\n\n\nIn the Project Explorer, select the current project, right-click, and select the Compile FlywizOS option in the pop-up menu. The function of this step is to automatically generate template code based on all UI files in the current project. Learn more about code generation details\nTake the UI file main.ftu as an example. After the previous step is completed, the file jni/logic/mainLogic.cc will be generated in the current project folder, as shown below :\n \n Note: main.ftu corresponds to mainLogic.cc, the prefixes of both are the same. Learn more about code generation details\n\nDouble-click to open mainLogic.cc, you should see the following function at the end of the file,\nstatic bool onButtonClick_Button1(ZKButton *pButton) {\n //LOGD(\" ButtonClick Button1 !!!\\n\");\n return false;\n}\n\nWhen the button control is clicked on the serial port screen, the system will automatically call the associated function. So, if you need to add your own processing code, just write it directly in the associated function.\n\nAs you can see, the function name is generated according to certain rules. Take the button control as an example, its function name generation rule is onButtonClick_XXXX(ZKButton *pButton), where XXXX will be replaced with the control ID,\nSo multiple button controls will generate different associated functions.\n\n\n\nLearn more about the associated functions of controls\nSystem buttons\nIn addition to the ID value defined by itself, the button also retains two system button values: sys_back and sys_home. From the name, we can roughly know their functions: Back button and Home button ; Click the back button, the activity will return to the previous activity, if you enter a multi-level activity, click the Home button to directly return to the main activity (start activity). We only need to set the ID value to sys_back or sys_home in the attribute box of the button to achieve the corresponding function.\n\nLearn more about activity interaction\nHow to handle long key press events\nIf you need to handle the long press event of the button, you need to manually add the long press event listener. Specific steps are as follows :\n\nIn the attribute table of the button, set the long press event trigger time and long press event cycle trigger interval two attributes; in the figure below, I set them to 1000 and 1000 respectively , The unit is milliseconds.\n\n\nAfter setting the properties, compile and open the corresponding Logic.cc file; at the top of the file, declare class LongClickListener and inherit the ZKBase::ILongClickListener class to implement the virtual void onLongClick(ZKBase *pBase) method.\n namespace { \n // Add an anonymous scope to prevent multiple source files from defining the same class name and conflict at runtime    \n\n //Realize the long press monitoring interface\nclass LongClickListener : public ZKBase::ILongClickListener {\n\n          virtual void onLongClick(ZKBase *pBase) {  \n                 LOGD(\"Trigger long press event\");\n             static int count = 0;\n\n                 char buf[128] = {0};\n                 snprintf(buf, sizeof(buf), \"Long press event trigger times %d\", ++count);\n                 //Each time a long press event is triggered, modify the text of the button\n                 mLongButtonPtr->setText(buf);\n          }\n};\n\n }\n\n\nNext, declare it as a static type\n static LongClickListener longButtonClickListener;\n\n\nRegister the button long press monitoring interface in static void onUI_init() function\n static void onUI_init(){\n\n         //Register the button long press monitoring interface\n         mLongButtonPtr->setLongClickListener(&longButtonClickListener);\n }\n\n\nUn-register the button long press monitoring interface in static void onUI_quit() function\n static void onUI_quit() {\n        //Un-register the button long press monitoring interface\n        mLongButtonPtr->setLongClickListener(NULL);\n }\n\n\nAfter adding the code, compile, download the program to the machine, and long press to test; you can see that the text of the button has been modified, and it means that the onLongClick function has successfully responded.\n For specific implementation, please refer to Sample Code\n\n\nHow to handle button touch events\nIf you need to respond when the button press or lift, you can do by registering the touch monitoring interface. Specific steps are as follows:\n\nImplement your own touch monitoring interface :\n namespace {    \n // Add an anonymous scope to prevent multiple source files from defining the same class name and conflict at runtime\n\n // Implement touch monitoring interface\n class TouchListener : public ZKBase::ITouchListener {\n public:\n     virtual void onTouchEvent(ZKBase *pBase, const MotionEvent &ev) {\n         switch (ev.mActionStatus) {\n         case MotionEvent::E_ACTION_DOWN:\n             mTouchButtonPtr->setText(\"Press\");\n             break;\n         case MotionEvent::E_ACTION_UP:\n             mTouchButtonPtr->setText(\"Lift\");\n             break;\n         default:\n             break;\n         }\n     }\n };    \n }\n\n\nNext, declare it as a static type \n static TouchListener sTouchListener;\n\n\nRegister the button touch monitoring interface in the static void onUI_init() function \n static void onUI_init() {\n     //Register the button touch monitoring interface\n     mTouchButtonPtr->setTouchListener(&sTouchListener);\n }\n\n\nUn-register the button touch monitoring interface in static void onUI_quit() function\n static void onUI_quit() {\n     //Un-register the button touch monitoring interface\n     mTouchButtonPtr->setTouchListener(NULL);\n }\n\n\nAfter adding the code, compile and download the program to the machine, click touch test; you can see that the text of the button has been modified.\nFor specific implementation, please refer to Sample Code  \n\n\nSample code\nSince there are many button control properties, please refer to the ButtonDemo project in Sample Code for more property effects\nSample preview effect picture :\n\n"},"checkbox.html":{"url":"checkbox.html","title":"Checkbox","keywords":"","body":"CheckBox\nThe check box is a control based on the button.

This control is specially designed to handle graphics rotation.\nThinking\nIf we want to implement an pointer, we can disassemble it into two parts, the static background image as the dial and the pointer image that rotates on the background image. \nTherefore, after selecting the background image and the pointer image, we only need to determine the center coordinates of the pointer rotation.\nHow to use\n\nWe first create an pointer control, you can see that it has the following properties:  \nIf you don’t know how to create a control, you can refer to How to create a button controlIn the property picture, you can see that I have added pointer image and background image\nThe adding process is shown in the animation :   \n\n\nJudging from the final preview image above, no problems were found, and the background image and pointer position looked normal. However, after the program actually runs, it is wrong. For quick and easy adjustment, we can set the starting angle property to other degrees (default is 0), here we adjust it to 120, we can find that after the pointer is rotated by 120°, the result of the pointer rotation is not what we expect like that.The reason for this is that the coordinates of the center of the circle where the pointer rotates are incorrect.There are two properties that determine the coordinates of the pointer rotation center, they are rotation point coordinates and fixed point coordinates \n\nRotation point coordinatesThe coordinates are with reference to the entire rectangular area of the control. The upper left corner of the rectangular area of the control is [0,0], in pixels. For such an instrument, obviously the coordinates of the rotation point we want are in the center of the dial. , Then the specific coordinates of the corresponding picture are (250, 250), as shown below :  \n\n\nFixed point coordinatesThe coordinates refer to the pointer picture, the upper left corner of the picture is [0,0], and the unit is pixel. For such a pointer picture, the fixed point coordinates of the pointer we want is (30, 210)  \n\nAfter filling the two coordinates into the attribute table, you can see that the pointer rotates to the correct position  \n\nStarting angle supports negative numbers. In the above example, if change the starting angle to -120, the pointer just points to the dial 0 position.\nTips on the fixed point of the pointer\n In the above example, the coordinate of the fixed point of the pointer is located in the pointer picture. In fact, this coordinate can also exceed the range of the picture to achieve the effect of the cursor. As shown in the figure below, the white in the red box is actually a pointer picture, which is relatively small, but in the property on the right, I set the coordinates of the fixed point of the pointer far beyond the real size of the picture, and then adjust the rotation coordinates to implement the effect of the circular cursor.\n \nOperation method\nThe most common method for this type of control is to adjust the rotation angle of the pointer through code. \n//Adjust the pointer to 90 degrees\nmPointer1Ptr->setTargetAngle(90.0);\n\nSample code\nFor the use of specific pointer controls, refer to the PointerDemo project in Sample Code.\n"},"listview.html":{"url":"listview.html","title":"List","keywords":"","body":"List control\nFunction\nThe list control is often used when a page cannot display all the information, and there are some consistent attribute classifications in each unit information.\nScenes\nWiFi list, device list, table information\nHow to use\n\nOpen the UI file, create a list control, and add two list item controls to the list.

Below is the modified result using the example : \n  \n\nAfter adjusting the general appearance of the list in the UI file, compile (How to compile the FlywizOS project). In the automatically generated correlation function, we need to add specific logic code to draw the specific content of the list.\nAfter compiling, in the corresponding Logic.cc source file, each list control will generate three related functions.\nint getListItemCount_ListView1()： Get the length of the list to be drawn  For example: there are 100 data to be displayed, then 100 is returned.\nvoid obtainListItemData_List1： Set the specific display content of each item in the list\nFor specific examples, see follow-up documents\nThe above two functions jointly control the display content of the list.\nonListItemClick_List1： Click event of list control\nWhen clicking on an item in the list, the system will call this function, and the parameter index represents the index value of the currently clicked list item.  \n\n\n\nList drawing process\n\nWhen we want to draw a list, the system first needs to know how many items it has in total, so we provide the int getListItemCount_ListView1() function, which will be called by the system to get the length of the list (the total number of items), Note that this function is dynamically obtained. During the running of the program, we can return different values according to needs, and then we can dynamically control the length of the list.   \n\nThen, the system will call the function void obtainListItemData_ListView1(ZKListView *pListView,ZKListView::ZKListItem *pListItem, int index) multiple times. For each call, we can use the pointer provided by the parameter in this function to control the specific content of each item in detail.\n\n\n\nExample 1. Set the display content of the list itemstatic void obtainListItemData_ListView1(ZKListView *pListView,ZKListView::ZKListItem *pListItem, int index) {\n  //The pListItem pointer represents a list item, which can only be used in this function\n  char buf[32] = {0};\n  //The parameter index indicates which item of the list is currently drawn, starting from 0.\n  //Here, we format the index value into a string\n  snprintf(buf, sizeof(buf), \"Item %d\", index);\n  //Display the string as text in the list item area\n  pListItem->setText(buf);\n  //If you have configured the list item \"Picture when selected\" in the ui file,\n  //Then, by setting the selected state of the list item through the following line of code, you can control the list item to\n  //display the corresponding state picture\n  pListItem->setSelected(true);\n}\n\n\nExample 2. Set the display content of the list subitemIf we use the list subitem, we can get the pointer of the list item by the following method, and then manipulate the list item through the newly obtained pointer.  \nstatic void obtainListItemData_ListView1(ZKListView *pListView,ZKListView::ZKListItem *pListItem, int index) {\n  char buf[32] = {0};\n  //The parameter index indicates which item of the list is currently drawn, starting from 0.\n  //Here, we format the index value into a string\n  snprintf(buf, sizeof(buf), \"The first child of item %d\", index);\n  //We can get the pointer of the list item through the findSubItemByID() function and the ID of the list item\n  //Same as the pListItem pointer, the list item pointer that is found can only be used in this function\n  ZKListView::ZKListSubItem* subitem1 = pListItem->findSubItemByID(ID_MAIN_SubItem1);\n  if (subitem1 != NULL) {\n      //Set the text of list item 1\n      subitem1->setText(buf);\n  }\n\n  snprintf(buf, sizeof(buf), \"The second child of item %d\", index);\n  ZKListView::ZKListSubItem* subitem2 = pListItem->findSubItemByID(ID_MAIN_SubItem2);\n  if (subitem2 != NULL) {\n      //Set the text of list item 2\n      subitem2->setText(buf);\n  }\n}\n\n\n\nThe idea of list\n In our system, the list is a mapping of a series of rule data.

You can see a rough preview of the diagram immediately. The specific creation process is as follows:\n  \n\nYou can add multiple waveforms to the diagram and adjust their appearance.\nNote: Since we cannot directly select a single waveform control on the preview image, when we need to adjust the specified waveform properties, we need to select on the outline view.\n  \n\nCheck the properties of the diagram and waveform controls respectively, you can find that diagram determines the value range of the x-axis, y-axis of the waveform, and the drawing area of the waveform. The waveform determines the appearance style of each waveform.\n   \n  \nAmong them, the two properties of step and erase space in the properties of waveform need to be explained.\n\n Step It represents the value of the advance of the waveform image every time you add a piece of data to the waveform. This value will be affected by the x-axis zoom property.\n\n\nErase SpaceIndicates the width of the vacanct part when the waveform is refreshed  \n\nThe above two properties are only valid when the waveform data is added using the void addData(int index, float data) function. \nCoordinate axis and scale\n The image scaling of the entire waveform is done automatically, we don't need to care about it, we only need to determine the x-axis range, y-axis range, and the rectangular display area of the entire waveform image in the property table.\nNote: The X scale and Y scale properties in the waveform control will multiply the value by the ratio and then draw it on the screen. The default is 1.0, which means no scaling.\n The coordinate axis of the waveform is determined by x-axis min value, x-axis max  value, y-axis min  value, and y-axis max  value. For example, the default x-axis range is [0, 100], y-axis range is [0,100], then the coordinate axis they form is\n   \n In general, the value entered in the x-axis min value property is smaller than the value of the x-axis max value property. But if the input minimum and maximum values are reversed, the waveform image drawn with the same data will be reversed; If you use the void setData(int index, const MPPOINT *pPoints, int count) function to add waveform data, the refresh direction will be reversed. Similarly, for the y-axis, drawing a waveform image will cause upside down.   \nCode operating\n  Similarly, the UI file only helps us quickly modify the appearance of the waveform, and the specific waveform data must be added through code. \n  In the public function of the project's jni/include/control/ZKDiagram.h file, you can see all the supported operations.  Note: Different from other controls, the Waveform control we added has ID attribute, but it does not generate independent pointer variables. Only the Diagram control that contains Waveform will generate pointer variables. Therefore, to operate a certain waveform, you need to use the Diagram pointer, and then use the index value to indicate which waveform is operated.\nThe value of index starts from 0. \n\nvoid setPenWidth(int index, int width)Set the waveform line width, corresponding to the pen width property on the property sheet\n\nvoid setPenColor(int index, ARGB color)Set the waveform color, corresponding to the pen color property on the property sheet\n\nvoid setXScale(int index, double xScale)Set the x-axis scale, corresponding to the x-axis scale property on the property sheet, \n\nvoid setYScale(int index, double yScale)Set the y-axis scale, corresponding to the y-axis scale property on the property sheet, \n\nvoid setData(int index, const MPPOINT *pPoints, int count)  \ntypedef struct _MPPOINT\n{\n    float x;\n    float y;\n}MPPOINT;\nThe MMPOINT structure contains the x and y values of a single data.\nThe function means to draw the count points in the pPoints array onto the indexth waveform. Note: The count value cannot be greater than the actual size of the pPoints array, otherwise the array will be out of bounds.The idea of using this function to draw waveforms is : First fill the data to be displayed into the sPoints array, and then draw the points in the array on the waveform at one time. Therefore, if you want to achieve the animation effect of the waveform moving to the left or right, you need to manually offset the value in the array by one subscript as a whole, and then display it on the waveform, and then shift it by one subscript as a whole, and then displayed on the waveform, and so on. Usually such a loop is implemented through a timer.So this method will cause the entire waveform image will be refreshed.\n\nvoid addData(int index, float data)\nAdd a single data to the waveform, data is the y value, you may wonder why there is no x value, because this function number is local waveform refresh, when you call this function to set the y value every time, The system will automatically offset a certain x value, and the size of this offset is the same as the set step property.Comparing void setData(int index, const MPPOINT *pPoints, int count) and void addData(int index, float data) two ways to refresh the waveform, it can be concluded that if the amount of data is large, the second method will have higher refresh efficiency.\n\nsetData(index, NULL, 0) To clear the waveform data\n\n\n\nAdditional method of wave movement\nAs mentioned earlier, if you use the void setData(int index, const MPPOINT *pPoints, int count) method to draw waveforms, you usually need to offset the values in the array by yourself.\nstatic void movePoints(MPPOINT* p,int size){\n    for(int i =0;i \nAdd timer to refresh waveform data regularly\nIn general, add a timer to match the waveform to facilitate regular refresh\nSample code\nEffect pictureFor the use of specific waveform control, please refer to the DiagramDemo project in Sample Code.\n  \n"},"circlebar.html":{"url":"circlebar.html","title":"Circle Bar","keywords":"","body":"Circular progress bar\nIn some cases, we need to display a \"Loading\" animation.

So there is the following correlation function\n static int getListItemCount_XXXX(const ZKListView *pListView) {\n       return 0;\n }\n\n\nParameter const ZKListView *pListView is the pointer of the list control, which points to the same object as the global variable mXXXXPtr. \n\nReturn value is an integer, which means how many items there are in the list, which can be defined according to your needs.\n\nAfter the system knows the number that needs to be drawn, it is not enough. It also needs to know what content you display for each item. So with the following function, it will be called multiple times, allowing you to set the display content of each item until each item is processed.\nvoid obtainListItemData_XXXX(ZKListView *pListView, ZKListView::ZKListItem *pListItem, int index) {\n //pListItem->setText(index)\n}\n\n\nParameter ZKListView *pListView is the pointer of the list control, which points to the same object as the global variable mXXXXPtr.   \nParameter ZKListView::ZKListItem *pListItem is the pointer of the list item, corresponding to the Item in the UI file\nParameter int index is the index value of pListItem in the entire list. It has a certain range. For example: The return value of the getListItemCount_XXXX function is 10, which means there are 10 items in the list. Then the range of index is [0, 9], combining pListItem and index, you can know where the list item you set now is in the entire list.In this function, you can set the display content of each item separately according to index.For example: The commented statement in the function means: each list item displays its corresponding index number as text.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSimilar to the button control, the list control also has a click event, but it judges which list item is currently clicked based on the index value.\nstatic void onListItemClick_XXXX(ZKListView *pListView, int index, int id) {\n   //LOGD(\" onListItemClick_ Listview1  !!!\\n\");\n}\n\nWhen the list control is clicked, the system will calculate the index number of the list item and will automatically call this function.\n\nParameter ZKListView *pListView is the pointer of the list control, which points to the same object as the global variable mXXXXPtr.  \nParameter int index is the index value of the currently clicked list item in the entire list control\nParameter int id is the id of the currently clicked control. Note that this id is different from the ID name in the attribute table. Its specific macros are defined in the corresponding Activity.h file. For example in mainActivity.h   \n\nThe function of this id parameter is that when there are multiple sub-items in the list item, it can be used to distinguish which sub-item is currently clicked.For example: As shown in the figure below, I added two list items to the list item and added a picture decoration as a switch button. The attribute ID names are SubItem1 and SubItem2 respectively. When I click on SubItem1 in the case of, by judging the equal relationship between the parameter id and ID_MAIN_SubItem1 and ID_MAIN_SubItem2, which switch is clicked can be determined.Example code :\nstatic void onListItemClick_XXXX(ZKListView *pListView, int index, int id) {\n   //LOGD(\" onListItemClick_ Listview1  !!!\\n\");\n   switch(id) {\n   case ID_MAIN_SubItem1:\n       //LOGD(\"Clicked the first subitem of item %d in the list\", index);\n       break;\n   case ID_MAIN_SubItem2:\n       //LOGD(\"Clicked the second subitem of item %d in the list\", index);\n       break;\n   }\n}\n\n \n  \n\n\n"},"first_app.html":{"url":"first_app.html","title":"The first startup activity","keywords":"","body":"When we create a new project, there is a Main.cpp file in the generated template code, path: jni/Main.cpp; the template code is as follows:\n\nThe code in the red box is the startup interface code, and the interface is mainActivity.

If it fails, it returns a negative number, which is an error code. . /dev/ttyS0 It can be understood as a serial port number, similar to COM1 on Windows systems.\n\nConfigure serial portAfter successfully opening the serial port, you need to configure the serial port and set the baud rate and other parameters.\nint openUart() {\n   int fd = open(\"/dev/ttyS0\", O_RDWR | O_NOCTTY);\n   struct termios oldtio = { 0 };\n   struct termios newtio = { 0 };\n   tcgetattr(fd, &oldtio);\n   //Set the baud rate to 115200\n   newtio.c_cflag = B115200 | CS8 | CLOCAL | CREAD;\n   newtio.c_iflag = 0; // IGNPAR | ICRNL\n   newtio.c_oflag = 0;\n   newtio.c_lflag = 0; // ICANON\n   newtio.c_cc[VTIME] = 0;\n   newtio.c_cc[VMIN] = 1;\n   tcflush(fd, TCIOFLUSH);\n   tcsetattr(fd, TCSANOW, &newtio);\n\n   //Set to non-blocking mode, this will be used when reading the serial port\n   fcntl(fd, F_SETFL, O_NONBLOCK);\n   return fd;\n}\n\n\n[!Note]\nThe above is the default serial port configuration of this platform, with 8 data bits, 1 stop bit, and no check. Do not modify for non-special needs.Limited by hardware and drivers, if you modify it to other configurations, it may be invalid.\n\n\nRead serial port\n#include \n\nunsigned char buffer[1024] = {0};\nint ret = read(fd, buffer, sizeof(buffer));\n\nread is a system function, which provides the function of reading the serial port. This function requires three parameters:\n\nThe first parameter is the serial port descriptor, which is the return value of the open function in the step of opening the serial port.\nThe second parameter is the buffer pointer, which is used to save the read serial data.\nThe third parameter is the length of the buffer, which also indicates the maximum number of bytes that can be read this time.\n\nCall the function,If the return value is greater than 0, it means that the serial port data has been received correctly, and the return value is equal to the number of bytes of data read.If the return value is less than or equal to 0, it means there is an error or no data is read temporarily.\n\nWrite serial port\n#include \n\nunsigned char buffer[4] = {0};\nbuffer[0] = 0x01;\nbuffer[1] = 0x02;\nbuffer[2] = 0x03;\nbuffer[3] = 0x04;\nint ret = write(fd, buffer, sizeof(buffer));\n\nwrite is a system function, which provides the function of sending serial port. This function requires three parameters :\n\nThe first parameter is the serial port descriptor, which is the return value of the open function in the step of opening the serial port.\nThe second parameter is the pointer to the buffer to be sent.\nThe third parameter is the length of the buffer to be sent\n\nCall the function,\nIf the return value is greater than 0, and the return value is equal to the third parameter passed, it means the transmission was successful.If the return value is less than or equal to 0, it means an exception.\n\n[!Note]\nThe read function only reads the data stream received by the serial port sequentially, but it cannot guarantee that the complete data will be read once.For example, in a short time, the serial port receives 1000 bytes of data, and the length of the buffer is 1024, although 1024> 1000,but maybe we only read part of the data after the first read, so we need to read multiple times to ensure that the data is read completely.\n\n\nClose serial port#include \n\nclose(fd);\n\nclose is a system function, and the required parameter is the serial port descriptor, that is, the return value of the open function in the step of opening the serial port.\n\nComprehensive use\nThe following is a complete example of a simple Linux serial port programming. The basic steps mentioned above are all used.  \n#include \n#include \n#include \n\nint main(int argc, char** argv) {\n  int fd = open(\"/dev/ttyS0\", O_RDWR | O_NOCTTY);\n  if (fd  0) {\n      //Output the read data to the log in turn\n      for (int i = 0; i \nHow to ensure stable communication of serial port from software\nWhen we try to apply the above examples to official products, we will inevitably encounter these problems:\n\nSerial communication may be disturbed to some extent, and it is unreliable. Therefore, a communication protocol is usually formulated. This protocol generally includes frame header, frame end, frame content, checkout, etc. The use of the protocol can ensure the integrity of the data to the greatest extent, making the serial port communication reliable.\nFor example:If we define the protocol, it starts with 0xFF and 0x55, followed by 8 valid bytes for a complete frame.Then the code of the Linux serial communication example above will probably be modified to look like this :\n//Only the key parts are listed, the rest of the code is omitted\nwhile (true) {\n unsigned char buffer[1024] = {0};\n int ret = read(fd, buffer, sizeof(buffer));\n if (ret > 0) {\n\n   if ((buffer[0] == 0xFF) && (buffer[1] == 0x55)) {\n     if (ret == 10) {\n       LOGD(\"Read a frame of data correctly\");\n     } else if (ret \n\nWhen we use the above code for actual testing and frequent sending and receiving, it is very likely that the protocol header is correct, but the frame length is wrong. why?  Because of Linux system scheduling or other reasons, the read function cannot guarantee that all data received by the serial port will be returned to you at one time. In order to read the serial port data completely, you need to call the read function multiple times, then splice the received data before and after, and then verify the data according to the protocol to find a valid frame. Although the code becomes complicated to do so, it is reasonable. Based on the analysis just now, modify the example code to look like this :  \n//Increase the scope of the buffer array so that the data will not be cleared in the while loop\nunsigned char buffer[1024] = {0};\n// Add a `legacy` variable to indicate the length of data left in the buffer\nint legacy = 0;\nwhile (true) {\n //According to the size of the legacy, adjust the start pointer and size of the buffer to prevent data overwriting\n int ret = read(fd, buffer + legacy, sizeof(buffer) - legacy);\n if (ret > 0) {\n   if ((buffer[0] == 0xFF) && (buffer[1] == 0x55)) {\n     if ((ret + legacy) == 10) {\n       LOGD(\"Read a frame of data correctly\");\n       //clean legacy\n       legacy = 0;\n     } else if (ret \n\nIn actual applications, we not only have to deal with serial communication, but also respond to the various buttons on the screen. In the above example, it starts with the main function, followed by a while loop, and then processes the serial port messages all the time, and cannot do other things. The Linux system supports multithreading. Usually, we will create a new child thread, and then put this while loop part in the child thread for processing, so that we will not delay our other operations. How to modify, the code is not given here.  \n\n\nSummary\nIn view of the serial communication programming on Linux, many detailed problems need to be dealt with, FlywizOS provides a general code, which solves the following problems : \n\nOpen, close, read and write operations of serial port \nSplicing of protocol\nProvide a unified data callback interface\n\nThe source code of this part is completely open source, you can create a new FlywizOS project at will, the source code is in the uart folder of the project.

In the next chapter of Communication Framework Explanation, we will focus on the principle and the parts that need to be modified, and deepen our understanding of this communication framework through some cases in this chapter of Communication Case Practice.\n"},"serial_framework.html":{"url":"serial_framework.html","title":"Communication frame explanation","keywords":"","body":"Communication framework explanation\nThis chapter focuses on the implementation principle of the communication framework. There are many theoretical things. The first time you can give a rough overview of the communication model, you will probably know the communication model. The supporting case do it yourself. it, and then come back. After understanding the principles, reviewing a few times and getting used to them,  you can customize the protocol any way you want.\nFrame\n\nThe software APP part is divided into two layers\n\nUart -Serial port HAL layer for protocol analysis and encapsulation\nUartContext：The physical control layer of the serial port, providing the serial port switch, sending and receiving interfaces\nProtocolData：Define the communication data structure, used to save the actual variables converted from the communication protocol\nProtocolSender：Complete the encapsulation of data transmission.\nProtocolParser：Complete the protocol analysis part of the data. Then put the parsed data into the data structure of ProtocolData. At the same time, it manages the callback interface for the application to monitor the serial data changes.\n\n\nAPP - application interface layer\nThrough the interface provided by ProtocolParser. Register the serial port data receiving monitor to obtain the updated ProtocolData from the serial port.\nThrough the interface provided by ProtocolSender. Send command information to MCU.\n\n\n\nLet's refine this process :\n\nYou can clearly see that the receive and send two processes are up and down, and the functions of each layer are relatively clear;\nSpecific to the process corresponding to the code :\n\nRegardless of whether it is a receiving or sending process, it is ultimately necessary to read and write to the serial port through the UartContext. This is a standardized process, so we basically do not need to modify the UartContext, and we can ignore how it is implemented. Yes, of course, you can check it out if you are interested.\nAt this point, we have a general understanding of this communication model, and then we will look at the implementation of the specific code.\nHow to use and modify the protocol receiving part\nModification of communication protocol format\nHere we give an example of a more common communication protocol\n\n\n\nframe header(2bytes)\ncommand(2bytes)\nlength of data(1byte)\ncommand data(N)\nverification(1byte, option)\n\n\n\n\n0xFF55\nCmd\nlen\ndata\nchecksum\n\n\n\nThe CommDef.h file defines synchronization frame header information and minimum data packet size information:\n// When you need to print the protocol data, open the following macro\n//#define DEBUG_PRO_DATA\n\n// Support checksum verification, open the following macro\n//#define PRO_SUPPORT_CHECK_SUM\n\n/* SynchFrame CmdID  DataLen Data CheckSum (Option) */\n/*     2Byte  2Byte   1Byte    N Byte  1Byte */\n// Minimum length with CheckSum: 2 + 2 + 1 + 1 = 6\n// Minimum length without CheckSum: 2 + 2 + 1 = 5\n\n#ifdef PRO_SUPPORT_CHECK_SUM\n#define DATA_PACKAGE_MIN_LEN        6\n#else\n#define DATA_PACKAGE_MIN_LEN        5\n#endif\n\n// Sync frame header\n#define CMD_HEAD1    0xFF\n#define CMD_HEAD2    0x55\n\nProtocolParser.cpp 文件，配置文件命令格式：\n/**\n * Function: Analyze protocol\n * Parameters: pData - protocol data, len - data length\n * Return value: the length of the actual protocol\n */\nint parseProtocol(const BYTE *pData, UINT len) {\n    UINT remainLen = len;    // Remaining data length\n    UINT dataLen;    // Packet length\n    UINT frameLen;    // Frame length\n\n    /**\n     * The following parts need to be modified according to the protocol format to parse out the data of each frame\n     */\n    while (remainLen >= DATA_PACKAGE_MIN_LEN) {\n        // Find the data header of a frame\n        while ((remainLen >= 2) && ((pData[0] != CMD_HEAD1) || (pData[1] != CMD_HEAD2))) {\n            pData++;\n            remainLen--;\n            continue;\n        }\n\n        if (remainLen  remainLen) {\n            // Incomplete data frame\n            break;\n        }\n\n        // To print a frame of data, open the DEBUG_PRO_DATA macro in the CommDef.h file when needed\n#ifdef DEBUG_PRO_DATA\n        for (int i = 0; i \nThe above analysis process is a bit complicated, let’s first give a picture, and then analyze it may be easier to understand. A packet of data may contain 0 to multiple frames of data. In the picture below, we have marked 3 frames of data. Another frame of data is incomplete, and there are 5 less data. The incomplete frame of data will be spliced to the next In a packet of data.\n\n\nProtocol header needs to be modified\n\n// 1.Modify the definition of the protocol header. If the length of the protocol header changes, pay attention to modifying the\n// statement of the protocol header judgment part.\n#define CMD_HEAD1    0xFF\n#define CMD_HEAD2    0x55\n\n// 2.You need to modify this when the length of the protocol header changes.\nwhile ((mDataBufLen >= 2) && ((pData[0] != CMD_HEAD1) || (pData[1] != CMD_HEAD2)))\n\n\nModification of changes in the position of the protocol length or the length calculation method\n\n// Here pData[4] represents the fifth data is the length byte, if it changes, please modify it here.\ndataLen = pData[4];\n// The frame length is generally the data length plus the head and tail length. If the length calculation method passed in the \n// agreement changes, modify this part.\nframeLen = dataLen + DATA_PACKAGE_MIN_LEN;\n\n\nWhen the verification changes\n\n/**\n * By default, we turn off checksum verification. If you need to support checksum verification, open the PRO_SUPPORT_CHECK_SUM \n * macro in the CommDef.h file\n * When the verification is different, the verification method needs to be modified.\n * 1.Check the content changes to modify this location\n *     if (getCheckSum(pData, frameLen - 1) == pData[frameLen - 1])\n * 2.Check the calculation formula changes to modify the content in the getCheckSum function\n */\n\n/**\n * Get checksum code\n */\nBYTE getCheckSum(const BYTE *pData, int len) {\n    int sum = 0;\n    for (int i = 0; i \n\nWhen the reception of a frame of data is completed, the program will call procParse to analyze\n\n    // Support checksum verification, open PRO_SUPPORT_CHECK_SUM macro in CommDef.h file when needed\n#ifdef PRO_SUPPORT_CHECK_SUM\n    // Get checksum code\n    if (getCheckSum(pData, frameLen - 1) == pData[frameLen - 1]) {\n        // Parse a frame of data\n        procParse(pData, frameLen);\n    } else {\n        LOGE(\"CheckSum error!!!!!!\\n\");\n    }\n#else\n    // Parse a frame of data\n    procParse(pData, frameLen);\n#endif\n\nHow to connect communication protocol data with UI controls\nContinue the previous protocol framework. We enter the parsing part of procParse.\nThe key code here is : ProtocolParser.cpp\nOpen the file and find void procParse(const BYTE *pData, UINT len)\n/*\n * Protocol analysis\n * Input parameters :\n *     pData: Start address of a frame of data\n *     len: Length of frame data\n */\nvoid procParse(const BYTE *pData, UINT len) {\n    /*\n     * Parse the Cmd value to obtain the data and assign it to the sProtocolData structure\n     */\n    switch (MAKEWORD(pData[2], pData[3])) {\n    case CMDID_POWER:\n        sProtocolData.power = pData[5];\n        LOGD(\"power status:%d\",sProtocolData.power);\n        break;\n    }\n    notifyProtocolDataUpdate(sProtocolData);\n}\n\nThe above MAKEWORD(pData[2], pData[3]) represents the Cmd value in our protocol example;\nWhen the data analysis is completed, the UI update is notified by notifyProtocolDataUpdate. For this part, please refer to the UI update part below\n\nData structure\n\nThe above protocol is parsed into the sProtocolData structure. sProtocolData is a static variable used to save the data value sent by the MCU (or other device) serial port.\nThis data structure is in the ProtocolData.h file. Here you can add communication variables that need to be used in the entire project.\ntypedef struct {\n    // You can add protocol data variables here\n    BYTE power;\n} SProtocolData;\n\n\nUI update\n\nThe UI interface has completed the registerProtocolDataUpdateListener when the tool generates Activity.cpp, which means that the page program in the logic will receive the data when the data is updated.\nstatic void onProtocolDataUpdate(const SProtocolData &data) {\n    // Serial data callback interface\n    if (mProtocolData.power != data.power) {\n        mProtocolData.power = data.power;\n    }\n\n    if (mProtocolData.eRunMode != data.eRunMode) {\n        mProtocolData.eRunMode = data.eRunMode;\n        mbtn_autoPtr->setSelected(mProtocolData.eRunMode == E_RUN_MODE_MANUAL);\n        if (mProtocolData.eRunMode != E_RUN_MODE_MANUAL) {\n            mbtn_external_windPtr->setText(mProtocolData.externalWindSpeedLevel);\n            mbtn_internal_windPtr->setText(mProtocolData.internalWindSpeedLevel);\n        }\n    }\n    ...\n}\n\nIn the code, we can see a variable mProtocolData, which is a static variable in the page. It will be initialized during onUI_init().\nExample :\nstatic SProtocolData mProtocolData;\nstatic void onUI_init() {\n    //Tips :Add the display code for UI initialization here, example : mText1->setText(\"123\");\n    mProtocolData = getProtocolData(); // Initialize the structure of the serial port data.\n    //Start the UI display of the initial page\n}\n\nSerial data sending\nOpen ProtocolSender.cpp\nWhen the APP layer needs to send data to the MCU (or other devices), it is enough to directly call sendProtocol.\nThe specific protocol encapsulation is completed by the sendProtocol method. Users can modify this part of the code according to their own protocol requirements.\n/**\n * Need to be spliced according to the protocol format, the following is just a template\n */\nbool sendProtocol(const UINT16 cmdID, const BYTE *pData, BYTE len) {\n    BYTE dataBuf[256];\n\n    dataBuf[0] = CMD_HEAD1;\n    dataBuf[1] = CMD_HEAD2;            // Sync header\n\n    dataBuf[2] = HIBYTE(cmdID);\n    dataBuf[3] = LOBYTE(cmdID);        // Command ID\n\n    dataBuf[4] = len;\n\n    UINT frameLen = 5;\n\n    // Data\n    for (int i = 0; i send(dataBuf, frameLen);\n}\n\nYou can operate when a button is pressed on the interface:\nBYTE mode[] = { 0x01, 0x02, 0x03, 0x04 };\nsendProtocol(0x01, mode, 4);\n\n"},"serial_example.html":{"url":"serial_example.html","title":"Communication case practice","keywords":"","body":"Communication Case Practice\nThrough the previous chapter Communication Framework Explanation, what may be seen is also in the cloud. Here we first summarize, serial communication mainly has the following 4 points:\n\nReceive data\nParse data\nDisplay data\nSend data\n\nThe parse data part is more complicated and needs to be changed according to the specific communication protocol; in this chapter, we will not talk about the theoretical things, and give some practical cases. You can play it a few times. .\nCase 1\nHere we still take the previous communication protocol as an example to implement a simple communication program of our own;For the complete code, see the UartDemo project in Sample Code;The final effect we want to implement is to send instructions through the serial port to control the rotation of the meter pointer on the display. The UI rendering is as follows:\n   \nWe only need to modify 3 places to control the rotation of the instrument pointer;\n1) Revisit the protocol format introduced earlier, here we add our own protocol command CMDID_ANGLE corresponding to the value 0x0001 :\n\n\n\nProtocol header(2bytes)\nCommand(2bytes)\nlength of data(1byte)\ndata(N)\nchecksum(1byte option)\n\n\n\n\n0xFF55\n0x0001（See belowCMDID_ANGLE）\n1\nangle\nchecksum\n\n\n\nWe add 1 variable to the protocol data structure, see ProtocolData.h:\n/******************** CmdID ***********************/\n#define CMDID_POWER            0x0\n#define CMDID_ANGLE            0x1    // new command ID\n/**************************************************/\n\ntypedef struct {\n    BYTE power;\n    BYTE angle;    // Added variable to save pointer angle value\n} SProtocolData;\n\n2) Since we are still using the previously defined protocol format, we do not need to make any changes to the protocol parsing part here, just process the corresponding CmdID value in procParse:\n/**\n * Parse each frame of data\n */\nstatic void procParse(const BYTE *pData, UINT len) {\n    // CmdID\n    switch (MAKEWORD(pData[3], pData[2])) {\n    case CMDID_POWER:\n        sProtocolData.power = pData[5];\n        break;\n\n    case CMDID_ANGLE:    // New part, save angle value\n        sProtocolData.angle = pData[5];\n        break;\n    }\n\n    // Notify protocol data update\n    notifyProtocolDataUpdate(sProtocolData);\n}\n\n3) Let's look at the callback function of the activity receiving protocol data, see logic/mainLogic.cc :\nstatic void onProtocolDataUpdate(const SProtocolData &data) {\n    // Serial data callback function\n\n    // Set the rotation angle of the pointer\n    mPointer1Ptr->setTargetAngle(data.angle);\n}\n\nAfter completing the above process, we only need to send the corresponding instructions to the screen through the MCU to see the rotation of the indicator pointer; for simplicity, we do not use checksum verification in this program, and the protocol data is as follows :\nprotocol header     CmdID     length of data    angle data\n0xFF 0x55         0x00 0x01        0x01            angle\n\nWe can open the DEBUG_PRO_DATA macro in the CommDef.h file to print the received protocol data:\n\nAt this point, receive data of the serial port ---> parse data ---> display data, even if it is finished; \nFinally, let's simulate the serial port send data. Here, in the program we give, a timer is started, and a data transmission is simulated every 2s:\nstatic bool onUI_Timer(int id) {\n    // Simulate sending serial data\n    BYTE data = rand() % 200;\n    sendProtocol(CMDID_ANGLE, &data, 1);\n\n    return true;\n}\n\nThe above code is actually an analog setting of the angle value. We can realize spontaneous transmission and self-reception by short-circuiting the TX and RX of the communication serial port on the screen, and we can also see that the indicator pointer rotates;\nThe introduction of our serial port demo program is over. Developers can compile and burn the demo program to the machine to see the effect, and then add some protocols on this basis to familiarize themselves with the entire communication process.\n"},"serial_configuration.html":{"url":"serial_configuration.html","title":"Serial port configuration","keywords":"","body":"How to configure the serial port\nSelection of serial port number\nDue to the design compatibility of software and hardware, the serial number of the software may be different from the serial number identification on the hardware.

It may happen that thread A executes a part of the instructions, then transfers to the B thread to execute some instructions, and then transfers to the A thread to execute the instructions.  For the above example, there are three statements in the A thread to complete the complete assignment of the student variable. When only the first statement is executed, only the assignment of the name is completed, and the system switches to B thread,  Then in the B thread, reading the student variable at this time, it will appear that the name field is valid, and the age and number are 0.\n  Other abnormal results are the same. \nHow to solve\n  By reason, as long as we ensure that all assignment operations of student in thread A are completed, thread B will read student variables, then there is no problem.\nHow to implement\n  In programming, there is a mutual exclusion lock concept to ensure the integrity of shared data operations. Each object corresponds to a tag that can be called a \"mutual exclusion lock\", which is used to ensure that at any one time, only one thread can access the object.\n  If you are familiar with Linux programming, you can use standard implementation. Here we introduce the use of our encapsulated mutex class. \n\nDefine a mutex \n\nstatic Mutex mutex1;\n\n\nWhere locking is required, define a local Mutex::Autolock class instance to lock.\n\n// This class utilizes the life cycle of local variables and the structure and destructor of C++ classes to automatically \n// implement locking and unlocking operations.\nMutex::Autolock _l(mutex1);\n\nCombining the above A and B thread examples, the modified code is as follows :\n#include \n\nstruct Student {\n  char name[24];\n  int age;\n  int number;\n};\n\nstruct Student student = {0};\n//Define a mutex \nstatic Mutex mutext1;\n\nclass AThread: public Thread {\npublic:\n  virtual bool threadLoop() {\n    //Lock the statement of the function, and automatically unlock after the function ends\n    Mutex::Autolock _lock(mutext1);\n    snprintf(student.name, sizeof(student.name), \"David\");\n    student.age = 10;\n    student.number = 20200101;\n    return true;\n  }\n};\n\nclass BThread: public Thread {\npublic:\n  virtual bool threadLoop() {\n    //Lock the statement of the function, and automatically unlock after the function ends\n    Mutex::Autolock _lock(mutext1);\n    struct Student s = student;\n    LOGD(\"nanme：%s\", s.name);\n    LOGD(\"age：%d\", s.age);\n    LOGD(\"student id number：%d\", s.number);\n    return true;\n  }\n};\n\nstatic AThread athread;\nstatic BThread bthread;\n\nIn the code, we lock the operations related to student in threads A and B.When the A thread is executed, the Mutex::Autolock _lock(mutext1); statement will obtain the mutex1mutex. When the A thread is not unlocked and the B thread is executed, the Mutex::Autolock _lock(mutext1); statement in the B thread, it also wants to obtain the mutext1 mutex. However, this mutex has been obtained by the A thread first. Now if the B thread wants to obtain it, it can only wait until the A thread releases mutext1, then the B thread can normally obtain the mutext1 mutex, and then continue to execute the next Statement.\nIn our project, there is also an example of using mutex, see the source code jni/uart/ProtocolParser.cpp :\nvoid registerProtocolDataUpdateListener(OnProtocolDataUpdateFun pListener) {\n    Mutex::Autolock _l(sLock);\n    LOGD(\"registerProtocolDataUpdateListener\\n\");\n    if (pListener != NULL) {\n        sProtocolDataUpdateListenerList.push_back(pListener);\n    }\n}\n\nIf you don’t understand the concept of mutex enough, you can get more information about mutexes from the Internet.\n"},"screenshot.html":{"url":"screenshot.html","title":"Screenshot","keywords":"","body":"Screenshot\nAfter the product is developed, when writing the manual, you may need a screenshot of the running interface.

provides multi-language function to facilitate internationalization.\nHow to add\n\nFirst, create a multi-language file through the new wizard.\n\n\nAfter creation, a subfolder named i18n will be generated under the project, and the default tr file will be added. The file name of each tr file represents the corresponding language (do not modify the file name at will).\n\nDouble-click to open the tr file, you can see that the content is in xml format. Each string tag represents a translation. The name attribute is used to give an alias (it is recommended to name it as a combination of English, numbers, and underscores), and then use the alias to represent the string in the code.\nNote: The alias cannot be repeated in the same configuration file.  \n\n\n\n\n\n    Hello world!\n    Hello, FlywizOS\n\n\nIf you want to wrap in the string, use &#x000A; to escape, as follows:\n\n\n    first line&#x000A;second line\n\n\nAs shown above, we will alias the string \"hello, world!\" as hello_world, and alias the string hello, FlywizOS as hello_flywizos, if we want to add For more translations, we just need to add the string tag according to the example.\n\nSince it is a multi-language, we have to add the same name tag to each language. In this way, when we switch languages, the system will replace the content according to the name attribute.\nAfter the configuration file is added, we can use it in the ui file and code.  \n\nOpen the ui file, we can input @hello_world in the text property (we use the @ symbol followed by the alias in the configuration file to indicate that this string needs to be translated). Then, we download and run, you can see that the content of the text has been automatically translated into Hello, world!     \n   \n\nWe can also translate strings in the code. Previously, we used the setText() function to set the string. If we need automatic translation, we need to use the setTextTr() function.\n E.g :    \n/**\n* Triggered when the activity is constructed\n*/\nstatic void onUI_init() {\n // The parameter of setTextTr() is the name value in the language file. Note: The string passed in here does not need to be\n // preceded by the @ symbol\n mTextview1Ptr->setTextTr(\"hello_world\");\n}\n\nDownload and run, we can see that the content has been replaced with the corresponding string.\n\nWe can also get the value corresponding to the current language name, and then do some operations like splicing, etc.:\n\n\n\n#include \"manager/LanguageManager.h\"\n\nstatic bool onButtonClick_Button1(ZKButton *pButton) {\n    //LOGD(\" ButtonClick Button1 !!!\\n\");\n    std::string hello = LANGUAGEMANAGER->getValue(\"hello\");\n    std::string world = LANGUAGEMANAGER->getValue(\"world\");\n    std::string ret = hello + \" \" + world;\n    LOGD(\"ret: %s\\n\", ret.c_str());\n    return false;\n}\n\nHow to switch language\n\nThe default language of the system is zh_CN (Simplified Chinese). \nYou can open the system's built-in language switch activity to select a language.Add the following code to open the activity.\nEASYUICONTEXT->openActivity(\"LanguageSettingActivity\");\n\nOr use the following API to switch languages freely.\n  EASYUICONTEXT->updateLocalesCode(\"zh_CN\"); //Set to Chinese\n  EASYUICONTEXT->updateLocalesCode(\"en_US\"); //Set to English\n  EASYUICONTEXT->updateLocalesCode(\"ko_KR\"); //Set to Korean\n\n\n\nFont requirements\n   Multiple language requires font support. If the text does not exist in the font, it will be displayed abnormally. Therefore, the font must contain text in multiple languages.\n\nThe default font of the system is a simplified version. It is recommended to add custom fonts, see Font cutting.\n\nSample\nFor the complete source code, please see the TranslationDemo project in Sample Code\n\n"},"adb_debug.html":{"url":"adb_debug.html","title":"ADB debug ","keywords":"","body":"ADB fast download and debug\nFlywizOS can quickly download programs to the machine via USB cable or WIFI.

We first introduce the general upgrade process of inserting a TF card.\nTF card detection upgrade process\nWhen the system is started or the TF card is inserted, if [TF card is normally mounted] (tf.md), the system will detect whether there is an update.img file in the root directory of the TF card (in the system, The root directory of the TF card is mapped to /mnt/extsd).If it exists, further verify whether the file meets the requirements. If it passes the verification, an upgrade prompt interface will pop up, and the user can choose to upgrade.If it does not exist, the detection process ends and there is no action.    \nImplementation steps\n\nFirst we have to download the upgrade image update.img. Under normal circumstances, downloading files through the HTTP protocol is the easiest way, of course, you can also choose other protocols according to the actual situation. After downloading, save the image file to the TF card directory /mnt/extsd/.   \n\n[!Note]\nIf there is no TF card inserted in the machine, this directory can still be written because it is stored in the memory.

Don't think about it too complicated. Just think of it as a structure in the C language. \nFor example :\n// C\nstruct Position {\n    int left;\n    int top;\n    int width;\n    int height;\n};\n\n// c++\nclass Position {\npublic:\n    int left;\n    int top;\n    int width;\n    int height;\n};\n\nDefine variables :\n// C\nstruct Position pos;\n\n// c++\nPosition pos;\n\nOperating variables :\n// C is the same as c++\npos.left = 0;\n\nThe class has more concepts of inheritance, polymorphism, overloading and access permissions than the structure in the C language. For people who are only familiar with the C language, they don’t need to pay too much attention to these details, as long as they master how to use it;\nIn addition, functions can be directly defined in class. The structure in C language is to define function pointers. This is a bit different. After class defines the function, it can be used like operating variables. Here Give an example commonly used in our framework :\n// Set the text content, where mTextView1Ptr is a pointer variable of type ZKTextView\nmTextView1Ptr->setText(\"Hello\");\n\nCommonly used class\nstring class\nThe string class actually encapsulates the string and provides a lot of functions. Person who are only familiar with the C language only need to know one function: c_str(), this function will return the characters in the string class string data, here is also an example commonly used in our framework:\n// Input box callback function\nstatic void onEditTextChanged_Edittext1(const std::string &text) {\n    // The return value type of c_str() function : const char *\n    const char *pStr = text.c_str();\n\n    // Then you can operate like ordinary strings, such as getting the string length strlen(pStr), etc.\n\n}\n\nGive another example of obtaining the content of a text control :\n// std is the namespace, std::string means to use the string class under std, don’t worry too much \n// When encountering the string class, we can refer to the following definition\nstd::string text = mTextView1Ptr->getText();\n\n// The subsequent operations are the same\nconst char *pStr = text.c_str();\n\nformatted output function \"snprintf\"\nFunction prototype :\n  int snprintf(char* dest_str,size_t size,const char* format,...);\n\nFunction :\n  The variable parameters (...) are formatted into a string according to format, and then copied to dest_str. \n  (1) If the length of the formatted string is less than size, copy the string to dest_str, and add a string terminator ('\\0') after it;  (2) If the length of the formatted string >= size, only (size-1) characters are copied to dest_str, and a string terminator ('\\0') is added after it, and the return value is the desired the length of the written string.\nRequired header files :\n  #include \nFormatting parameters\n\nSpecifier%d Decimal signed integer%u Decimal unsigned integer%f Floating point%s String%c Character%p Pointer value%e Exponential floating point%x, %X Unsigned integer in hexadecimal%o Unsigned integer in octal%g Output the value according to the smaller output length in %e or %f type%p Output address%lu Output long integer\n%llu 64-bit unsigned integer   \n\nDescription  (1).You can insert a number between \"%\" and the letter to indicate the maximum field width.  For example: %3d means to output a 3-digit integer, which is not enough to be right-justified.  %9.2f represents a floating-point number with a field width of 9, where the decimal place is 2 and the integer place is 6,\n  the decimal point occupies one digit, which is not enough for 9 digits to be right-justified.  %8s means output a string of 8 characters, which is not enough to right-justify 8 characters.  If the length of the string or the number of integers exceeds the specified field width, it will be output according to its actual length.  But for floating-point numbers, if the number of integers exceeds the specified width of integers, it will be output as actual integers;  If the number of decimal places exceeds the specified width of decimal places, the output will be rounded according to the specified width.  In addition, if you want to add some zeros before the output value, you should add a zero before the field width term.  For example: %04d means that when outputting a value less than 4 digits, 0 will be added to the front to make the total width 4 digits.  If a floating point number is used to represent the output format of characters or integers, the number after the decimal point represents the maximum width, and the number before the decimal point represents the minimum width.  For example: %6.9s means to display a string with a length not less than 6 and not greater than 9. If it is greater than 9, the content after the 9th character will be deleted.  (2).You can add a lowercase letter l between \"%\" and the letter to indicate that the output is a long number.  For example: %ld means output long integer  %lf means output double floating point number  (3) You can control the output to be left-aligned or right-aligned, that is, add a \"-\" sign between \"%\" and the letter, indicating that the output is left-aligned, otherwise it is right-aligned.  For example: %-7d means that the output 7-bit integer is left-justified  %-10s means output 10 characters left-justified   \n\nSpecial specifier\\n Wrap\\f Clear screen and change page\\r Carriage return\\t Tab character  \n\n\nExample\n\nDirect output integer\nchar buf[64] = {0};\nsnprintf(buf, sizeof(buf), \"%d\", 314);\nLOGD(\"%s\", buf);//Log output buf\n\nThe log output is  \n314\n\nControl the number of digits of the integer\nchar buf[64] = {0};\nsnprintf(buf, sizeof(buf), \"%05d\", 314); //Format as 5 digits, less than 5 digits, add 0 in front\nLOGD(\"%s\", buf);//Log output buf string\n\nThe log output is  \n00314\n\nOutput floating point number directly\nchar buf[64] = {0};\nsnprintf(buf, sizeof(buf), \"%f\", 3.14); \nLOGD(\"%s\", buf);//Log output buf string\n\nThe log output is  \n3.140000\n\nControl output floating point number format\nchar buf[64] = {0};\n//Output decimals, a total of 6 characters wide (including the decimal point), 3 decimal places, two integer digits, and 0 if   //the integer is less than two digits\nsnprintf(buf, sizeof(buf), \"%06.3f\", 3.14);\nLOGD(\"%s\", buf);//Log output buf string\n\nThe log output is  \n03.140\n\n\n"},"touchcalibration.html":{"url":"touchcalibration.html","title":"Touch calibration ","keywords":"","body":"Touch calibration\nAfter the resistive touch screen machine is flashed, the system will perform a touch calibration the first time it is turned on.

These logs will be output when the program is started and initialized, so you can use this to determine whether the program has restarted. \n  \nMost of the causes of program crashes can be attributed to incorrect usage of pointers. E.g  \n\nNull pointer\nArray out of bounds\nDid not pay attention to the life cycle of the pointer, but the memory is still in use after the release \n\netc.Since the project uses C and C++ language programming, it is inevitable that we need to deal with raw pointers in terms of pointer memory, which requires us to be extra careful.\nThere is another kind of crash, which may be caused by not paying attention to the error of Divisor cannot be 0.\nIf the program is stuck, from the log, there is no restart phenomenon, then we can check from thread deadlock, whether the code loops indefinitely, there is a long time-consuming operation, causing the stuck the illusion of death analyze these situations.\n\n\nFor more questions, please go to Forum to search or ask questions\n"},"install_adb_driver.html":{"url":"install_adb_driver.html","title":"install ADB driver","keywords":"","body":"How to use the Android ADB driver installer for Windows XP/Vista/7/8/10\n\nDownload the [driver installation program] (http://dl.adbdriver.com/upload/adbdriver.zip) first.\nConnect the Android device to the computer via USB.\nIn the ADB driver installer, click the Install button to continue.  \n   \n\nIf the system prompts that Windows cannot verify the publisher of this driver software, please select \"Always install this driver software\" in the \"Window Security\" dialog box.\n\n  \n\nThe universal android usb driver will be automatically installed on your computer.    \n  \n\nFinally, ADB Driver Installer will show that the installation was successful\n\nWindows XP users are recommended to restart after installing the driver.\n\n\n\n"},"convert_platform.html":{"url":"convert_platform.html","title":"Convert platform","keywords":"","body":"Convert compile platform\nIn order to facilitate the use of the same project source code on different hardware platforms, the function of Convert Compie Platform is provided.\nSteps :\n\nSelect the project name, right-click, and select Convert Compile Platform in the pop-up context menu to quickly switch platforms.\n\n\n\nFor the conversion function, the following points need to be noted:\n\nThe conversion function is essentially to reconfigure the compilation environment such as the compilation tool chain, and there will be no changes to the source code.\nThe hardware of different platforms is different, so the hardware-related settings such as serial port and GPIO need to be modified manually.\nDue to differences in toolchain versions, compilation failures may occur after conversion.
