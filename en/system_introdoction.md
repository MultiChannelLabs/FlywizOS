This system is based on Linux system development, adding a self-developed system framework and GUI interactive system.
We call it the FlywizOS system.

## System target scenario :
The current Internet of Things industry is developing rapidly. With the drop in the price of liquid crystal display, the demand for user window display, screening is coming. All displays will become displays.

In view of the current development, Multi Channel Labs has proposed a more suitable display solution at the current stage.  
    
   1. Replace the use of Android in the following small application scenarios, such as home appliances, access control and other product scenarios with simple functions, high system stability requirements, and high cost-effective requirements	
   2. Replace the traditional black-and-white display or MCU-driven color display solution, and improve the interactive experience in a low-cost way.	
   3. The arrival of the IoT and sharing scenarios has brought more demand for display windows and interaction. Provide system support with high cost performance and high stability.
